### [**Post-Hoc Methods** — Improving the Quality After the Fact](../05-post-hoc)
After training, we'll explore methods to enhance model performance after training, including model averaging and applying LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation).
- **Inference Parameterrs**: Built-in ways to improve the Quality.
- **Model Averaging**: Merging checkpoints to improve the model further.
- **Applying LoRA**: How to implement Low-Rank Adaptation to fine-tune your model.
