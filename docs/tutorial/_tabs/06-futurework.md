### [**Post-Hoc Methods** â€” Improving the Quality After the Fact](../05-post-hoc)
After training, we'll explore methods to enhance model performance after training, including model averaging and applying LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation).
- **Inference Parameterrs**: Built-in ways to improve the Quality.
- **Applying LoRA**: How to implement Low-Rank Adaptation to fine-tune your model. (link to the previous text2brick lora finetuning)
